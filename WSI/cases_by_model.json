Upon closer inspection, it is evident that the tumor has invaded the peripancreatic soft tissue and has also invaded the duodenum, with the additional finding of perineural invasion. However, a thorough examination has not revealed any evidence of lymph node involvement. The surgical margins have been carefully evaluated, and it has been determined that they are negative for carcinoma, with the common bile duct, pancreatic duct, and deep radial margins all being free of tumor. Furthermore, the specimen exhibits chronic pancreatitis, as well as focal high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of pancreatic invasive ductal adenocarcinoma is confirmed, with a stage classification of pT3 pNO.",
