# Human Evaluation UI

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Install
```bash
cd humanEvaluation
npm install
```

## Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes
- The app expects data files in `WSI/` at the repo root (e.g. `WSI/cases_by_model.json`, `WSI/medGemma.json`, `WSI/sampled_reports.csv`).
- Large tiles folders are excluded from the repo by default.
